# SC42001 Control System Design



This folder is for Notes from TU Delft Course: SC42001 Control System Design.

This course has a very briefly overview for basic control theory without focusing too much on mathematical details. This course also paid attention to Model Predictive Control. However, because I have learned MPC course, this part will not be contained.

In this folder, compared to the original course materials

1. MPC part is ignored
2. The content structure is re-organized by myself and the restructured version make more sense to me.
